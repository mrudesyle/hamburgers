# hamburgers* Hamburgers - https://whatta-burger.herokuapp.com/ - is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page, in the "You Can Eat This" column-- waiting to be devoured.* When the Burger button in the "You Can Eat This" column is clicked, that item is moved to the right hand column, the "You Ate This" column. When items in the "You Ate This" column  are clicked, they will be added back to the "You Can Eat This" column.* The app stores every burger in a MySQL database, whether devoured or not.* Technologies utilized includes:		--> MySQL		--> Node		--> Express		--> Handlebars		--> Proprietary ORM *  The app follows the MVC design pattern; it uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, and Handlebars to generate HTML.
